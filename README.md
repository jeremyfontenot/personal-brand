About Me
Hello! I'm Jeremy C. Fontenot, a dedicated IT professional with a genuine passion for technology and a knack for problem-solving. With over 4 years of experience in the field, complemented by a lifetime of curiosity about how technology works, I've transitioned from a hobbyist tinkering with devices to a skilled professional ready to tackle any IT challenge.

At 49, inspired by my undying interest in technology and encouraged by my supportive wife, I made a pivotal decision to shift my career path. I enrolled in Remington College's Database Administration program, stepping back into the academic world after 30 years. There, not only did I graduate with honors, but I also made the Dean's List in all terms except one, a testament to my commitment and drive to excel in this new field.

Today, I bring to the table a solid foundation in technical support, system administration, and IT service management. My experience spans across providing exceptional service desk support, managing complex IT infrastructures, and ensuring the security and efficiency of IT operations. Beyond my technical skills, my real passion lies in the joy of solving problems and the satisfaction of helping others through technology.
